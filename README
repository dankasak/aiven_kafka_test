==================
Build Instructions
==================

This directory contains a Makefile that assists in building and running the docker container.
You should set the NS variable to something appropriate to your environment.

To build, run:

 make build

To enter the container ( to examine things - it contains pudb3 for python debugging ), run:

 make shell

==================
Usage Instructions
==================

This repository contains 2 scripts: run_consumer.sh and run_producer.sh. These run the
container in different modes ( executing os_stats_consumer.py or os_stats_producer.py ).
These scripts also should be edited to refer to your local environment ( ie replace:
 tesla.duckdns.org with your hostname you build the container on ).

Both of these scripts have command-line arguments, for defining connection details for
Postgres and Kafka. I've set defaults for all args, which are valid for the Avien services
I've been developing against. I've also included the Kafka access keys in the container.
You can pass args into the container by appending them to the end of the wrapper scripts.
I've left 1 arg in each wrapper script as an example.
